# Image Steganography Application

A modern GUI application for hiding secret messages within images using steganography techniques. Built with Python and Tkinter.


## Features

- Support for multiple image formats (PNG, JPG, BMP)
- Text input directly or from files
- Password protection for message encoding/decoding
- Modern dark-themed GUI interface
- Real-time status updates
- Fast encoding and decoding
- Save encoded images in high-quality PNG format

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
https://github.com/ferroflux/Secure_Data_Hiding_in_Image_Using_Steganography.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Run the application:
```bash
python steganography_app.py
```

2. To encode a message:
   - Click "Select Image" to choose your carrier image
   - Enter your secret message or use "Load from File" to load from a text file
   - Enter a password for security
   - Click "Encode Message"
   - Choose where to save the encoded image

3. To decode a message:
   - Select the encoded image
   - Enter the password used during encoding
   - Click "Decode Message"
   - The hidden message will appear in the output section

## Technical Details

The application uses the following techniques:
- LSB (Least Significant Bit) steganography
- Password-based message protection
- Custom pixel manipulation using OpenCV
- Message length preservation in image metadata

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV (opencv-python)
- Pillow
- NumPy
- Tkinter (included with Python)
